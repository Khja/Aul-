# AulÃ«
Software for documenting conlangs, particularly their morphology. It's still under construction.
Features:
- make tables for declension or conjugation generation;
- make templates for the table column and row names to reuse the same table multiple times;
- simple regex-based rule creation;
- immediately test the morphology rules with an example;
- name the rules in one table and reuse them in another;
- organise your tables in a tree-based system with folders;
- add words to the dictionary.

The software will be available soon.
