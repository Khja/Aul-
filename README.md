## Current status
Software for documenting conlangs, particularly their morphology. It's still under construction.
Features:
- make tables for declension or conjugation generation;
- make templates for the table column and row names to reuse the same table multiple times;
- simple regex-based rule creation;
- immediately test the morphology rules with an example;
- name the rules in one table and reuse them in another;
- organise your tables in a tree-based system with folders;
- add words to the dictionary.

The software will be ready soon.

## Project objectives
The main goal is to create a relatively user-friendly program intended to document morphology, notes on the usage, and vocabulary of a conlang. The software will very unlikely include:
- phonetic transcription generation;
- conscript support and romanisation;
- media (audios, images, videos, etc.) support.

Everything written in the conlang should thus be a romanisation of some kind.

Maybe in a far future it will include:
- evolution;
- statistics.
